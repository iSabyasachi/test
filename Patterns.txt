1. Sliding Window :

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among 
all the subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.
Ex : Given an array, find the average of all subarrays of ‘K’ contiguous elements in it.

2. Two Pointers :
3. Fast & Slow Pointers :
4. Merge Intervals
5. Cyclic Sort
6. In-Place Reversal of a LinkedList
7. Tree Breadth First Search
8. Tree Depth First Search
9. Two Heaps
10. Subsets
11. Modified Binary Search
12. Bitwise XOR
13. Top 'K' Elements

Any problem that asks us to find the top/smallest/frequent ‘K’ elements among a given set falls under this pattern.

The best data structure that comes to mind to keep track of ‘K’ elements is Heap. This pattern will make use of the Heap 
to solve multiple problems dealing with ‘K’ elements at a time from a set of given elements.
